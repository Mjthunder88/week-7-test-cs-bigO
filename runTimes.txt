As the number of entries increases the time that it takes gets longer but for the largest array it seems that append function handles it the best. It has a more constant runtime because its just adding on numbers onto the end. It doesn't havae to shift all the numbers over as its adding to the array.

As for when the array is smaller the insert function is faster because it having to move other values over doesn't take that much time. Insert has more of a linear runtime. 

So overall append is the better function if you plan on pushing a large amount of numbers through the function, it will scale better. 

Extra Credit: After looking into it says that .unshift() is a O(n) or linear because of it having to move all of the values over one when its added to the front. So as the array gows the amount of time it takes will go up at a decent rate.
